# ðŸ§  TransUNet: Transformer Meets U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation ðŸ©º

Welcome to the **TransUNet** repository! This project combines the **Transformers** with the classic **U-Net** architecture to provide powerful segmentation results in the medical imaging field. Whether you're working with histopathological images or any other medical imaging data, TransUNet offers a cutting-edge approach to achieve precise segmentation.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Merges the self-attention mechanism of **Transformers** with the localization strength of **U-Net**.
- **Multi-Scale Feature Extraction**: Captures both global and local information, crucial for medical image analysis.
- **Optimized for Medical Image Segmentation**: Specifically tuned to handle the unique challenges of medical imaging, such as varying resolution and structure sizes.
- **Flexible and Adaptable**: Suitable for a wide range of segmentation tasks, including liver tumor detection, lesion segmentation, and histopathological image analysis.
